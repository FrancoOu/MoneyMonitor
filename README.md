# MoneyMonitor

## This is the project that I have developed for Monash's iOS development unit(FIT3178).
### It is a simple app that allows users to record their expenses and incomes and provides a visual summary. 
### Also, users can add their periodical bills so that users will get notified when the billing date is approaching.
